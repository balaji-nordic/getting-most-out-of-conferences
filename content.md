Notes:
- This is an informal talk—let’s discuss why tech conferences are great for both individuals and the company.

#### Why Conferences?

- Break barriers
  - It’s easier to approach people when everyone’s wearing the same lanyard
- New ways of thinking and perspectives
  - Inside the company, we often get stuck in a loop. If you're only talking to your colleagues, feedback can be limited.
  - Conferences expose you to fresh ideas and new tools
- Honest feedback

Notes:
- You’ll often get more objective, even positive feedback from people you’ve just met at conferences.
- I thought I knew everything about testing until I went to a test conference!

#### Why It’s Not Just OPEX
- It’s Not Just OPEX, It’s Opportunity!
- Learn from new people
- Personal/professional growth
- ROI for the company
  - Employee branding and talent acquisition
  - It shows that we care about continuous learning.
Notes:
  - Sending employees also boosts the company’s brand, attracting new talent.

#### Maximize Conference Time
- Distribute yourselves
  - Everyone brings back different ideas.
- Pac-Man principle
  - When you’re standing in a group, leave a gap for someone to join in.
- Speak English
  - So you’re more inclusive.
- Fireside chats > tracks
- Make sure to attend talks on unfamiliar topics.
  - You may be surprised how it may be relevant to you. Plus you get a expert contact.

Notes:
- Speak in English when in group settings so you’re more inclusive. Private conversations in your native language are fine, but in public, English is more welcoming.
- Quick fireside chats can be more productive than some formal sessions. I once had a 5-minute chat at a conference that transformed how we did code analysis!

#### External Conferences vs. Internal Training
- Exposure to broader challenges
  - You learn how others solve similar problems, which is invaluable
- Peer-to-peer learning
  - Internal training has its place, but external conferences give you a wider view of what's happening across the industry.

#### How can managers help

- Help their team find these opportunities.
- 2 to 4 conference days a year is a great sweet spot
- Encourage employees to speak
  - Save on travel/accommodation while building brand.
  - The only cost is the time spent preparing the talk.
- And remember—time spent at conferences is work time, not vacation!

---
#### Sponsor a conference

- The name badge is the best sponsorship! But even a booth works.
- Usually comes with free tickets for a few employees
- Send engineers to staff the booth—not just sales folks.

---
#### Example conferences

- NDC techtown, NDC Oslo and NDC Security (Oslo)
  - Great place for software and embedded folks
- adacon (Oslo)
  - Focusses on diversity, software, leadership
  - Helps folks get on stage and mentor them
- Oslo Business Forum
  - Business and leadership
  - Companies can become members and allow employees to view leadership talks.

#### Example conferences

- Trondheim developer conference
- Boosterconf Bergen - Beginner friendly
- Skaperfest Trondheim
  - Great for showing of what you made - Software, hardware, art etc.

#### Conclusion

- Conferences => Innovation
- Don’t think of it as just a break. It’s a break <u>*for*</u> innovation!
- Conferences plant seeds for new ideas.
  - You won’t see results right away, but the long-term growth can be incredible.
